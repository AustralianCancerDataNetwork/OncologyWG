Description: This package implements the survminer and survival packages to plot Kaplan-Meier Curves and Time-to-Treatment Histograms as demonstrated at the OHDSI Symposium in September 2019. The goal of this implementation is to take advantage of the OMOP CDM v5.0 by executing the same SQL, ensuring consistent aggregation and analytics across multiple institutions.
